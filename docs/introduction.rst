Welcome to MMC
====================

MMC (Metropolis MUD Client), is a modern fully-featured MUD client written in `Python <http://www.python.org>`_, and utilises a set of powerful frameworks to take your gaming experience to the next level.

* The GUI is made using `WX Python <http://www.wxpython.org>`_, and as such can be modified by your scripts on the fly.
* Sound support is included, allowing you to script body-jarring explosions and blood curdling monster sounds at will. You can even used 3d sound if your hardware supports it.
* Synthetic speech can be output, giving you a further method of digesting game information quickly.
* Add your own configuration objects just like :ref:`world-options` using :ref:`confmanager-object`.
* Anything you can do with Python, you can do with MMC.

Aliases and triggers both use `Python's regular expressions <https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#regex-howto>`_, giving you awesome control over your scripts.

Classes allow you to toggle on and off sections of code at will, and access to all the functions exposed to MMC it's self are there for you to utilise.

To learn how to program with MMC, please see the section :ref: `programming`.
