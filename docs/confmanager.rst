This module is used to generate :ref:`world-options`. At it's heart is Python's own `ConfigParser <https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html>`_, with a wx GUI over the top.

If you would like to use it in your own projects, it is freely available from `the confmanager github <https://github.com/chrisnorman7/confmanager.git>`_.
