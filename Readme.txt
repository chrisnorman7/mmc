About MMC:
Metropolis MudClient (MMC) is a fully featured MUD client written in the Python programming language.

* MMC is written in pure Python. As a result, it's highly scriptable. You can completely redesign the user interface in your scripts if you wanted. You can have worlds communicate with each other. You have access to the currently loaded classes, as well as all the functions used internally.
* It has all the features you'd expect from a modern MUD client: Aliases, triggers, a raft load of configuration options, accessible output if you can't see the GUI, including braille support.
* Anything that's not directly available can be programmed in with scripts. Hotkeys and timers for example, and as many threads as your computer can handle.
* It's portable, so you can comfortably run it from your pen drive.
* Planned: A log parser which will allow you to play back your game logs in real time, so you can relive those events and epic battles.

It's currently free, and will probably stay that way. Even if I do decide to takemoney for it, it'll be probably be on a donations basis, so don't worry that you'll not get updates.
